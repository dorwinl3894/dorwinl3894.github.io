        <p class="project-desc-title">Introduction</p>
        <p class="project-desc"> 
          This project focuses on identifying key variables correlating with heart disease using logistic regression. I analyzed the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, applying logistic regression, KNN, and Naive Bayes models in R to pinpoint crucial health factors.
        </p>

        <p class="project-desc-title">Research Questions</p>
        <p class="project-desc"> 
          The questions I wanted to answer were:
          <ol>
            <li>Which health metrics and tests correlate the most to heart disease?</li>

          </ol>

          This will help me draw insights into the prevention of heart disease in high risk individuals.
        </p>


        <p class="project-desc-title">Data Source</p>
        <p class="project-desc"> 
          The analysis is based on the official dog bite incident records provided by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, covering the years 2015-2022.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data">UCI Heart Disease Dataset</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="project-desc"> 
          This dataset contains
          <ul>
            <li>Rows: 920</li>
            <li>Columns: 16</li>
            <li>Each row is a patient with variables related to their health.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="project-desc-title">Data Preprocessing in Excel and R</p>
        <p class="project-desc">Taking a look at the dataset, I realized that 3 columns had way too much missing data,
          which I couldn’t fill in or remove the rows for, so I dropped the columns. The three columns
          are ‘ca’, ‘thal’, and ‘slope’ which represent the number of major vessels, heart defects, and the
          slope of the peak exercise ST segment, respectively. Next, I also removed the ‘id’ column as it
          would interfere with the accuracy of the model given that the column was just an index of each
          row. For the remaining 12 columns, I needed to remove rows with missing values in the
          variables that had missing values in them. To check which columns had missing data, I created
          a filter on Excel and spotted 7 columns that had missing data. In R, I created a list of these
          columns and used a built-in function to automatically remove rows where there are missing
          values. This resulted in a total of 741 rows remaining in our dataset.</p>
          <p class="project-desc">
            For the next step, I converted categorical variables into a format that the models could
interpret better using one-hot encoding, which turns a categorical column into separate columns
with 0 or 1 indicating its presence or not. To do this, I researched and found out that there was
a library called fastDummies that could help make this process more efficient and get rid of
human error.
          </p>
        <p class="project-desc">Afterwards, I ran into a problem with the logistic regression model I used later on
            where it wouldn’t run because of a multicollinearity issue, so I resolved this by getting rid of
            columns that was giving me this issue.</p>
        <p class="project-desc">I then converted the rest of the categorical variables which were ‘sex’, ‘s’, and ‘exang’
              into the binary format they needed to be in for the models to interpret. In the last step of the data
              preprocessing stage, I scaled the numerical columns to standardize them. I did this for the
              six numerical columns in this dataset using the scale function in R</p>

        <p class="project-desc-title">Exploratory Data Analysis</p>

        </div>


        <p class="project-desc-title">Data mining Methods</p>
        <p class="project-desc">The first and most ideal model I chose was logistic regression because it fit the
          question I intended to address perfectly. I wanted to see which variables greatly contribute
          to the presence of heart disease and logistic regression is a model that helps predict the
          probability of a binary outcome, and in addition, provides us with coefficients for each variable to
          see how much it contributes, as well as how statistically significant it is. Its interpretability is an
          advantage as it would allow our target audience, public health officials, to fully understand the
          impact of each variable. For all of our models, I used all of the variables available in our
          processed dataset. Specifically for logistic regression, the process of one-hot encoding of
          categorical variables was crucial for ensuring the model performed as expected because logistic
          regression is designed to work with numerical values.</p>

          <p class="project-desc">KNN is the second model I chose to use because it can predict patterns and clusters in
            the dataset. I wanted to use a model that had a classification approach and dealt with the
            data’s proximity to one another. To use KNN, I included scaling to standardize numerical
            columns so that all variables contributed equally to the distance algorithm that KNN relies on. The
            model runs ten times for the number of neighbors in the model, which was up to 10. Then the
            dataset is divided into five folds randomly with one fold being used as the test set, and the
            remaining four folds as the training set. The model then has a matrix that contains the accuracy
            for each combination of neighbors and folds for model performance analysis.</p>

            <p class="project-desc">For our third model, I chose to use Naive Bayes to test if it would outperform the other
              two models. The different algorithms would help give a different perspective on the dataset by
              showing how related the variables are to one another. To create a Naive Bayes model, I
              imported a package that I found through research that contains a function for the Naive Bayes
              classifier. The Naive Bayes function will be the same as the other models in the way that all
              variables will be used in the model.</p>

        <p class="project-desc-title">Calculating and comparing model performances </p>
        <p class="project-desc">To see the performance of the three different models, I used 5-fold cross-validation to
          calculate the average accuracy of the models. I also extracted the confusion matrix of the last
          folds of each model to calculate its respective recall, precision, and accuracy.</p>
          <img src="assets/project3_6.png" alt="">
     
        <p class="project-desc">The table (Figure 1) above shows the average accuracy of each model as well as the
          recall, precision, and accuracy of the last fold of each model. By comparing the performance of
          the three models, I can see that KNN had the best accuracy in predicting the presence of heart
          disease with 91% accuracy. Logistic regression and Naive Bayes had about the same in terms of
          average accuracy at 80.77% and 78.54% respectively.</p>

        <p class="project-desc">Looking at the last fold of each model, KNN also beat out the other two models in terms
          of precision and recall. in the scenario where a model is built to predict the presence of heart
          disease, it is important for accuracy, recall, and precision to be high. Accuracy reflects the overall
          correctness of the model which is important. A high recall rate means that false negatives are
          minimized which is extremely important because not correctly identifying a patient with heart
          disease can lead to serious consequences. Having high precision is also beneficial to minimize
          unnecessary interventions with patients who do not have early signs of heart disease.</p>

          <p class="project-desc-title">The best model for predicting the presence of heart disease </p>

        <p class="project-desc">Although KNN has the highest accuracy, recall, and precision, the model does not directly
          give us the answer I was looking for. Logistic regression remains the best model in predicting
          the presence of heart disease because it directly answers the question I was looking for. The
          ability to estimate the effect size of each variable is crucial in a task like identifying what
          contributes most to heart disease. While KNN has a higher predictive accuracy, logistic
          regression provides valuable insights into the specifics. With an average accuracy of 80.77%, it is
          still a high-performing model that is much more accurate compared to a random classifier.</p>

        <p class="project-desc">The summary of the logistic regression (Figure 2) allows us to view the coefficient of each
          variable and whether it is statistically significant or not. Through this summary, I was able to
          see that four statistically significant variables had high correlations with heart disease. These four
          variables are the gender of the person (sex), the presence of exercise-induced chest pain
          (exang), ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak), and chest pain that had no
          symptoms (cp_asymptomatic).</p>
          <img src="assets/project3_7.png" alt="">
        <p class="project-desc-title">Actionable steps for public health officials</p>
        
        <p class="project-desc">From knowing the four statistically significant variables that strongly correlate with the
          presence of heart disease, I can provide actionable steps for public health officials to inform
          the public.</p>

        <p class="project-desc">Firstly, given that gender is statistically significant and has a positive value, it means that
          men are more likely to develop heart disease than women. Additionally, the presence of
          exercise-induced chest pain also correlates highly with the presence of heart disease. To tackle
          this, public health officials can create and launch targeted campaigns for men who have chest
          pain while exercising and persuade them to get a heart health screening.</p>
        
        <p class="project-desc">According to the model, it appears that the presence of heart disease is also prevalent in
          those who have asymptomatic symptoms, meaning they have an underlying medical condition
          but without knowing it because it does not physically affect them. In this case, ST depression
          induced by exercise is highly correlated to the presence of heart disease as well as
          asymptomatic chest pain. These two conditions are not easily noticeable as it does not have a
          reaction in your body that would have you thinking something is wrong. To solve this issue, public
          health officials will also have to make another campaign focusing on the entire population,
          focusing on addressing misconceptions about heart disease, and emphasizing that early signs of
          heart disease can be asymptomatic.</p>

          <p class="project-desc-title">Conclusion</p>
        <p class="project-desc">Using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset and a logistic regression model, I was able to
          reveal four statistically significant variables that contribute to the presence of heart disease.
          These variables are gender, exercise-induced chest pain, ST depression, and asymptomatic chest
          pain. These findings are important and relevant for public health officials as they can create
          health campaigns targeted towards men with high risk of heart disease as well as health
          campaigns that inform the general population of asymptomatic heart disease.</p>
        
          <p class="project-desc">However, the results of our models should be taken with a grain of salt given the
            limitations of the dataset. There may be other variables that have an even higher correlation to
            the presence of heart disease which were not part of the dataset I used. During the data
            pre-processing, I also had to remove 179 rows in the dataset which accounted for roughly
            19.4% of the data, leaving the model to work with 741 rows of data which is not much data to work
            with given an industry such as healthcare where precision and accuracy is important and the size
            of the dataset greatly affects those measures.</p>
